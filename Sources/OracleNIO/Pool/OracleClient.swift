///
/// You create a ``OracleClient`` by first creating a ``OracleConnection/Configuration``
/// struct that you can use to configure the connections, established by the client.
///
/// @Snippet(path: "oracle-nio/Snippets/OracleClient", slice: "configuration")

/// ## Running a client
///
/// ``OracleClient`` relies on structured concurrency. Because of this, it needs a task in which it can
/// schedule all the background work it needs to do in order to manage connections on the users behave.
/// For this reason, developers must provide a task to the client by scheduling the client's run method
/// in a long running task:
///
/// @Snippet(path: "oracle-nio/Snippets/OracleClient", slice: "run")
///
/// ``OracleClient`` can not lease connections, if its ``run()`` method isn't active. Cancelling
/// the ``run()`` method is equivalent to closing the client. Once a client's ``run()`` method has
/// been cancelled, executing queries will fail.
